## Usage Instructions

1. Click on any empty time slot in the calendar
2. Fill in the booking details:
    - Select date and time
    - Choose client, service, location, and technician
    - Set price and add notes
    - Choose status (booked, confirmed, etc.)
3. Click "Skapa" to create the booking

### Editing Bookings

2. Modify the booking details as needed
3. Click "Uppdatera" to save changes
4. Use "Radera" to delete the booking

### Drag & Drop Operations

- All changes are automatically saved to the database

### Viewing Statistics

The statistics widget shows:

- Total number of bookings

- Current week's bookings

## File Structure

### Backend (PHP/Laravel)

```
app/
├── Http/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   │   └── Api/
│   │       ├── CalendarBookingController.php    # Main CRUD operations
│   │       └── CalendarDataController.php       # Dropdown data endpoints
│   └── Requests/
│       └── Api/
│           ├── StoreBookingRequest.php          # Create validation
│           └── UpdateBookingRequest.php         # Update validation
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

```
resources/js/
├── components/
│   ├── event-calendar-demo.tsx           # Main calendar component
│   └── calendar-stats.tsx              # Statistics widget
└── pages/
    └── calendar.tsx                      # Calendar page
```

### Routes

All API routes are defined in `routes/web.php` under the `/api/calendar` prefix and require authentication and email verification middleware.

## Database Integration

The system integrates with existing database tables:

- `booking_bookings` - Main bookings table
- `booking_clients` - Client information
- `booking_services` - Available services
- `booking_locations` - Service locations
- `users` - Service users/technicians (role = 'service')
- `booking_calendars` - Calendar configurations

## Error Handling

- Server-side validation with Swedish error messages
- Client-side error display with user-friendly messages
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- Automatic calendar refresh on successful operations

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient database queries using Eloquent relationships
- Lazy loading of dropdown data
- Optimized date range queries
- Resource filtering to reduce data load
- Caching of route definitions

## Security Measures

- All endpoints protected by authentication middleware
- CSRF token validation for state-changing operations
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- Input sanitization and validation
- Authorization checks for resource access

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Touch support for mobile drag operations
- Accessibility considerations for keyboard navigation
