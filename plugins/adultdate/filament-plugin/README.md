This is where your description should go. Limit it to a paragraph or two. Consider adding a small example.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require adultdate/filament-shop
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-shop-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-shop-config"
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-shop-views"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
];
```

publish the package assets using:

```bash
php artisan filament:assets
```

Finally, make sure you have a **custom filament theme** (read [here](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/styling/overview#creating-a-custom-theme) how to create one) and add the following to your **theme.css** file:

This ensures that the CSS is properly built:
```css
@source '../../../../vendor/adultdate/filament-schedule/resources/**/*';
```

This is optional but highly recommended as it will apply styles to better fit with the (default) filament theme:
```css
@import '../../../../vendor/adultdate/filament-schedule/resources/css/theme.css';
```

Add to Plugin to Filament panel:
```php
use Adultdate\FilamentShop\FilamentShopPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            FilamentShopPlugin::make()
        ])
}      
```
